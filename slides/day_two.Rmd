## .fancy[Version control]

.pull-left[
- Research papers have many versions before publication
- two main challenges:
  - keeping track of changes and versions
  - reverting a previous version if necessary 
- different approaches for version control:
  - edit, rename and save files
  - use applications (Dropbox, Google Docs, Overleaf)
  - use version control systems such as Git and GitHub

#### 🎈 Contribute to open source projects, see [here](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/)
- almost all open source projects use GitHub

#### 🎤 Showcase your work


#### 🔍 Track changes across versions 
]

.pull-right[
#### 👨‍🔬 👷‍♀️ Collaborate on projects

## .fancy[Version Control &mdash; Git and GitHub &mdash; Definitions]

### Git <img src="img/git.png" width="50px" >

- a software that keeps track of versions of a set of files
- it is *local* to you; the records are kept on your computer

--

### GitHub <img src="img/github.png" width="70px" >

- a hosting service, or a website, that can keep the records
- it is *remote* to you, like the Dropbox website
- but unlike Dropbox, GitHub is specifically structured to keep records with Git



---
class: middle, inverse

## .fancy[Version Control &mdash; Git and GitHub &mdash; Definitions]

### Repository, or repo
- a set of files whose records are kept together, by Git and/or on GitHub
- it is like a folder, which can keep files and other folders containing files

--

### To commit
- to take a snapshot of, or to version, a repository
- it is like saving a new version of all files and sub-folders in your project folder with a new name
- it is local, the records are kept on your computer unless you push

--

### To push
- to move a copy of the records from Git to GitHub, from your computer to online server
- it is like uploading (the new versions of) your files and sub-folders to a website

#### In the 📱 terminal 📱, type:

.blue-h[`git pull origin master`] 

--

4) Create a new branch to add changes that belong to a novel feature you are working on (this prevents messing up the master branch)

.blue-h[`git checkout -b "cool-feature"`]

--

5) Now make some changes (e.g., add the new cool feature)

--

6) Add, commit, and push the files 
...through the usual workflow (`git add .`, `git commit -m "new feature file added"`) 😴


--

 🚧 👀 BUT you push the changes to the newly created branch to prevent messing up the master branch! 👀 🚧

7) On GitHub, you create a pull request

Reviewers (other team members) may be assigned to check the changes and start a conversation (through comments)

--

8) Once all issues are resolved, your changes will be merged into the master branch 🥳 


---

class: middle, inverse

## .fancy[Version Control &mdash; Git and GitHub &mdash; collaborating]

... But what if some issues remain unresolved?  👆"You forgot to read in the data!" 🤔

--

You may add small things through `git add .`, `git commit -m "added data reader"`, `git push origin branch-name`

--

❗ BUT if some time has passed or the addition is major❗

--

⏩ Checkout to the master branch:

.blue-h[`git checkout master`]

--

Pull all changes that happened in the mean time:

.blue-h[`git pull origin master`]

--

Checkout a new branch for the missing feature;

.blue-h[`git checkout -b data-reader`]

--

Make the necessary changes!

--

... And then, the usual workflow (don't forget to push to new branch!)

## .fancy[.center[Build a site local with GitHub]]

### .fancy[.center[`r emo::ji("computer")` + <i class="fab fa-github fa-lg fa-fw"></i>]]

1. Make a [repo on <i class="fab fa-github fa-lg fa-fw"></i>GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html#make-a-repo-on-github-1)

1. Connect remote repo to local 

1. Create a new R project

1. In console, run:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(blogdown)
new_site(theme = "jpescador/hugo-future-imperfect", 
         sample = TRUE, 
         theme_example = TRUE, 
         empty_dirs = TRUE,
         to_yaml = TRUE)
```



???

if an exampleSite exists, it will be in themes/<hugo-future-imperfect>/exampleSite

theme_example copies that exampleSite into your project root directory (you can always delete the content later)

sample adds a sample R Markdown blog post (can end up in wrong place though)

empty_dirs keeps some folders that are initially empty but for important reasons I'll tell you about

finally, to_yaml converts all the exampleSite content to YAML instead of TOML files. We'll talk more about the difference, but this saves you time and is helpful to have done automatically for you.

- `<title>Ada Lovelace</title>`

- `ignoreFiles`: copy and paste this from your R console when you first served your site

- *.bright[Very important!]* Setting `relativeURLS` is critical for `r emo::ji("cloud")` setup

???

The first thing I do with any new Hugo theme is make sure the baseurl is just a forward slash. That will always work. This theme has that already, but some don't

Do not change theme here- but it refers to the theme folder you want.

You could have multiple Hugo themes in your themes/ directory.

So the theme name should match the name of the folder that holds the theme you want to use.

Mouse over to `static/img/main/` and see `logo.jpg`? We can replace that file, or make new file. I'll replace mine with [this picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apreshill/ada-blog/hugo-theme-future-imperfect/static/img/main/ada_square.jpg).

```{r eval = FALSE}
[params.intro]
  header    = "Ada Lovelace" #<<
  paragraph = "A fine place to share my thoughts" #<<
  about     = "" #<<
  # This appears at the top of the sidebar above params.intro.header.
  # A width of less than 100px is recommended from a design perspective.
  [params.intro.pic]
    src       = "/img/main/ada_square.jpg" #<<
    # Sets Image to be a cirlce
    circle    = false
    # Sets Image to be Future Imperfect's hexagon
    imperfect = true
    width     = ""
    alt       = "Ada portrait from Wikipedia" #<<
```

In the Hugo framework, static things are images, CSS, JavaScript, etc.

So you can assume that any image files are expected to be somewhere in the static directory.

Here, it looks like the exampleSite used the path static/img/main. So mouse over there and see if you see logo.jpg. 

You could save over that image, or you can add another image and update the file name in the config file.


When Hugo builds your site, all assets inside your static directory are copied over as-is.

### Edit the `config.toml` to customize your site.

Ideas:

+ Update your `[[menu.main]]` text, Font Awesome icons (or remove!), or switch weights (the order).
+ Set up your `[social]` media icons.
+ Change the `highlightjs` theme.
+ Switch some of the "Optional Params"- see what they do.

.bright[.fancy[Stretch:]] All possible Hugo configuration variables are [listed here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/)- try some (like `enableEmoji = TRUE`)!

themes is where all the Hugo theme files go.

This determines the look and layout of your site, as well as the bells and whistles that each individual Hugo theme developer employs. It also may leave out some Hugo bells and whistles that you DO want. 

IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOUR THEME

You also never touch this folder!

So how do you edit a Hugo theme if you are not to touch anything in this folder?

# `r emo::ji("key")` Overriding vs editing

> *When you use a theme cloned from its git repository, do not edit the theme’s files directly. Instead, theme customization in Hugo is a matter of overriding the templates made available to you in a theme. This provides the added flexibility of tweaking a theme to meet your needs while staying current with a theme’s upstream.*

This is why we kept the empty directories when we started our site.

I believe having these here will help you when you do want to edit your theme, as a gentle reminder that you are never to touch the themes folder!

You can create new content files in Hugo using the hugo new command. By default, Hugo will create new content files with at least date, title (inferred from the file name), and draft = true. This saves time and promotes consistency for sites using multiple content types.

# TOML vs. YAML

- TOML is like YAML, but not 
- blocks wrapped by `+++` vs `---` 
- Your `config.toml` file doesn't show this explicitly but it is there!
- key-value pairs are separated by a `=` vs `:` 
- YAML uses indentation with one or more spaces to describe nested collections 


--

This is why we used `new_site(to_yaml = TRUE)`!

--

If you end up with TOML in your content, try (after backing up your files):
```{r eval = FALSE}
hugo_convert(to = "YAML", unsafe = TRUE)
```

1. update the `index.html` layout
